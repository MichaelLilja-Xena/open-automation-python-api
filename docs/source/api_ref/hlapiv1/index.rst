High-Level API (V1)
========================

HL-API uses the classes defined in LL-API and lets you quickly develop scripts or program in an **object-oriented** fashion with explicit definition of commands of different *tester*, *module*, *port* types. In addition, the HL-API layer provides functionalities such as:

* :ref:`Auto connection keep-alive <session_label>`
* :ref:`Auto index management <resource_managers_label>`
* :ref:`Resources identification tracking for push notification <event_subscription_label>`

The high-level Python APIs are categorized into six groups:

* Testers
* Modules
* Ports

* Exceptions
* Utils
