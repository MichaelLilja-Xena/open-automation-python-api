Introduction
=====================================================

Xena OpenAutomation Python API (XOA Python API) Documentation provides Xena Python Application Programming Interface (API) functions. It also provides descriptions of how to use these functions along with examples of creating and running test configurations.

The target audience is test automation specialists who develop automated test scripts/programs using Xena hardware and
software. Users of this manual should have the following knowledge and experience:
* Ability to program with Python language.
* Familiarity with the operating system of your development environment.
* Familiarity with test equipment.
* Working knowledge of data communications theory and practice.

About Xena OpenAutomation Python API
----------------------------------------

Many of our customers choose to develop their own test scripts, where they automate performance verification, regression test, development verification, and so on.

At Xena Networks, we have always been providing customers with the best tool for test automation. To help our customers achieve a more efficient quality control and continuous development verification, we have developed a new platform Xena OpenAutomation, overlaying various Xena hardware and virtual testers, to offer not only automated test suites but also the power to build programs from simple scripts to advanced applications with endless possibilities.

The cornerstone component of Xena OpenAutomation is its Python API, which contains more than 600 commands, from basic streams creation to advance eye diagrams measurement. With this rich collection of programming interfaces, we empower our customers to either write test scripts or develop applications with almost limitless possibilities.
